Notes for Nesting Workbench


#TODO
Create a grid on a sheet (gridresolution) with each point stored in a list. Each point will have a bool
to represent if it's occupied. Since each part is represented by a box which fits evenly on our grid we can place each
 part with the bottom left corner of the bounding box. Since we know how many grid section the rectangular box takes
 , we can make every vert except for the top row and the right column of verts as occupied.

 We then move on the next largest part and place that to the right of this part.


 Each grid vert stores an enum of the state (empty, edge, filled). Every bounding box (The shape bounds) will 
 be converted to a grid with a resolution to match the grid. Each part grid will have a state of edge for 
 verts at the edge of the bounds, filled for any verts inside the bouds, and empty for all points in voids
 or outside of the bounds.

 We will convolve the shape similar to convolution in vision processing. We'll move the shape from left to right 
 across the bottom and rotate it 90 degrees 4 times at each step (if rotation is enabled).

 We will do a fitment check at each step. If every edge and filled vertex matches with an empty vertex on the grid
 then the shape fits and we place it there. For every edge or filled vertex in the part grid, set the grid
 vertex to edge or filled


 Set the vertex color on the grid to white - empty, red- edge, blue - filled
