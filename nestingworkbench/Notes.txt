#TODO
Place labels on upper bounds of shapes instead of at a fixed position. Leave the input

Need a way to cancel simulation. If nest button pressed twice, first instance continues to run.

Symetry optimaztion for rotation checks


maximize overlap area 
check bounds overlap area

 Fix Minkowski nesting small objects in voids

 simulate Minkowski
 set Minkowski as defaulkt algo

 Minkowski performance

 Transform tool
Add color when mouseover
hotkey for rotation

falloff radius - blender inspired, brush size
